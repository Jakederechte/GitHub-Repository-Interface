# GitHub-Ropository-Interface

Just download the "GitHub Uploader.exe" file in the "Runnable exe" directory and run it in the directory with the Github repository. (The repository must already exist for the program to work). Now an interface opens to download and upload changes. Also, this program has an autosave functionality, where all changes are automatically uploaded.
